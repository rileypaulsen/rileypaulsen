I’m a freelance designer, full-stack developer, and educator located in and around the Indianapolis market.

If you're familiar with “Glue People,” I‘m one of those. My specialties run both wide and deep.

You won’t find much publicly accessible code on my profile, but rest assured that whenever I’m not building something creative, I’m working to train [the next generation of designers and developers](https://digitalcorps.bsu.edu). My style centers around the Socratic method, with tabs over spaces, and often borders on Absurdism. *Quality is the highest pursuit.*

You can get in touch with me about design and development on [my website](https://rileypaulsen.com) and [stalk me professionally](https://linkedin.com/in/rileypaulsen), or check out my [wedding and event photography work](https://photos.rileypaulsen.com).
